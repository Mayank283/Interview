/**
 * As Joshua Bloch explains: The builder pattern is a good choice when designing
 * classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful
 * of parameters. Thus when many representations of a class is possible then we
 * can use builder pattern. Factory pattern returns the constructed object at
 * once. But in builder pattern the object returned depends on multiple choice
 * that we have. Usually the evolution takes place starting with factory->
 * abstractFactory->Prototype or Builder
